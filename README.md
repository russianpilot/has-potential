Processing Code for Collage

This code was written in Processing 3 as an exercise in my Collage.

The main function is to place a few objects on a sqare field with a random distributen of electric charge.
By calculating the mean of a field(x, y) by suming up the potential of the fields around, it can calculate the
value of the electric potential for this field.
